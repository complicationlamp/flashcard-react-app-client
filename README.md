HELP REQUEST: have any ideas about how I can make this better? I have a few, but Iâ€™d love to hear yours. Please help me with some outside perspective and submit a pull request.

SUMMARY: To solve the overlap in learning react and not forget some of the basics, I figured I could kill two birds with one stone here and build out a study application for some computer science topics in react. After looking around at sites catering to this market one thing stuck out to me, the were all quite busy. When I study I like an environment that is free from distraction and as my previous apps have been awash with color and imagery, I felt that doing a sleek, predominantly monochromatic design would deliver a better product and be a challenge. Also, as a long-time train commuter I wanted to make this a more mobile first design, so I and others can make better use of our commute. 

THE API: the API is set up to register and store user information, making use of JWT for the authentication process. The questions are accessed in a typical CRUD operation, but for the purpose of not letting a malicious user edit community flashcards put operations for questions have been removed.

TECHNOLOGY USED:  The Client is built with: React, Redux, and Enzyme for testing. All styling was done in CSS without the use of pre-built libraries like Bootstrap.
The Api makes use of Node, Nodemon, Mocha, Chai, Bcryptjs, Body-parser, CORS, Express, Json Web Tokens, passport
